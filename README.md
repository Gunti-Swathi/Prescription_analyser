# **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Medical Prescription Classification System**! This project is an innovative blend of computer vision and large language model (LLM) techniques, designed to revolutionize how medical prescriptions are analyzed and interpreted. 

## **Problem Statement**
Medical prescriptions are a cornerstone of healthcare, yet their handwritten and often inconsistent formats pose significant challenges. Misinterpretation of prescriptions can lead to medication errors, affecting patient safety and treatment efficacy. Current solutions are either too rigid or lack the adaptability to handle the diversity of prescription formats.

## **Objective**
This project aims to:
1. **Digitize and Interpret Prescriptions**: Extract handwritten and printed text from prescription images with high accuracy.
2. **Drug Identification**: Recognize drug names within prescriptions and identify their intended uses.
3. **Contextual Insights via LLMs**: Provide a conversational interface that explains the purpose, usage, and potential side effects of the identified drugs using comprehensive medical knowledge.
4. **Empower Healthcare Systems**: Reduce errors, save time, and improve the overall efficiency of prescription processing.

## **Why This Project?**
Medical prescription analysis is a multifaceted challenge requiring robust solutions that can bridge the gap between raw image data and actionable insights. By combining state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with the contextual understanding of LLMs, this system provides a comprehensive tool for healthcare professionals and patients alike. 

Through this project, we aim to not only enhance the accuracy of prescription digitization but also enable informed decision-making, improving the quality of healthcare delivery worldwide.
